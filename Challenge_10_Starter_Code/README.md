## Challenge_10 README

# Crypto Clustering

---

## About This Program

This program uses Scikit Learn to apply unsupervised learning to cryptocurrency data. We will implement KMeans to help cluster the data for better visualization and compare with Principal Component Analysis to help streamline the data for better analysis and visualization.

## Technologies

This program can be run with Mac or Windows systems along with the following requirements:

Python 3.7.1

Pandas

Jupyter Lab Notebooks

Hvplot

SKlearn
